It‚Äôs time to explore more about the basic linux commands to complete task-3 of #day3 challengeüëç.

‚úî cat filename: to display the content of the file.
‚úî mv source destination: to move a file from source to destination.
‚úî rm filename: to remove a file.
‚úî rm -rf directory: to remove a directory by removing all the files recursively.
‚úî chmod xxx filename: to change the mode (read, write or execute) of a file.
‚úî head -x filename: to display the x no. of entries of a file from the top (head).
